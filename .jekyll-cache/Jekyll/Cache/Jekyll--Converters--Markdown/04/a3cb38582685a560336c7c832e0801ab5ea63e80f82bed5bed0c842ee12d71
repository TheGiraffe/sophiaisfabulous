<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Asthimo was a group project for Biomedical Engineering Skills 2 (ENG 2012), where we were tasked with designing an asthma inhaler for children. Asthimo is a friendly, robot-shaped, customizable inhaler that includes an inhaler spacer in his backpack. Spacers have been shown to improve the effectiveness of inhalers for children, who sometimes struggle with the dual task of pressing down on the inhaler and inhaling at the correct time, because the spacer is able to contain the medicine longer to allow the child to inhale it. Spacers can be important for developing the habit of medical adherence. One of the main reasons for why we designed Asthimo to be cute, colourful, modular, and customizable with many different outfits, is to make the inhaler fun and eye-catching for children aged 6-12, and thus help reduce medical non-adherance for children who regularly need to utilize their non-emergency inhaler for preventative reasons.</p>

<h2 id="group-roles">Group Roles</h2>
<p>This was a group project where there was four of us: Me, Alistair, Lucia, and Gabriel. All of us took on different roles, since this project <strong>literally</strong> involved lots of moving pieces. One of my roles was sketching our teamâ€™s ideas during the team meetings, since I like to draw.</p>
