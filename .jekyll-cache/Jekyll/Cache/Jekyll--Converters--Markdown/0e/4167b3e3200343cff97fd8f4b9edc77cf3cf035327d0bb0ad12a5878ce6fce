Aloha, I am Sophia! :hibiscus:</p>

<p>I am a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. I am originally from Maui, an island in the Hawaiian Islands (USA). :palm_tree:</p>

<p>I am an alumna of <a href="http://www.kiheicharter.org/">Kihei Charter School</a>, where I graduated in 2018. I am also proud to be an alumna of the Maui Economic Development Board Women in Technologyâ€™s <a href="https://www.stemworkshawaii.org/">STEMworksâ„¢ program</a> and the Nalukai Foundationâ€™s <a href="https://nalukai.org/">Nalukai Academy Startup Camp</a> (2016 cohort). If you have been looking through my work, especially my projects from high school, and if you like what you see, please consider supporting these organizations that make a huge difference in the education and future of Maui youth.</p>
