Aloha, I am Sophia!</p>

<p>I am a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. I am originally from Maui, an island in the Hawaiian Islands (USA).</p>

<p>I am an alumna of <a href="http://www.kiheicharter.org/">Kihei Charter School</a>, where I graduated in 2018. I am also proud to be an alumna of the Maui Economic Development Board Women in Technology’s <a href="https://www.stemworkshawaii.org/">STEMworks™ program</a> and the Nalukai Foundation’s <a href="https://nalukai.org/">Nalukai Academy Startup Camp</a> (2016 cohort).
