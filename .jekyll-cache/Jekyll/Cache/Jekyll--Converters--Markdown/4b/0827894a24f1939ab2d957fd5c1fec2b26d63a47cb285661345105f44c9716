<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Cell Town:</strong> Started as a biology assignment in high school, I built Cell Town from scratch in Google Sketchup when I was 14 years old. I am revisiting it now as an adult studying biomedical engineering, with the question of how digital tools and analogies can be used to help teach complicated topics such as biology. I wonder, how can we envision, simulate, approximate, and animate the inner workings and complexities of very complicated things such as cells? Could we take things such as vesicle transport and enzymatic reactions and DNA replication - and make these concepts come alive? Can we create virtual worlds that allow students to literally explore a cell or a cell analogy? I know that biomedical engineering - and particularly synthetic biology, cell-based biosensors, and cell-component based bio-computers - are all going to play a major role in the future of humanity. And from my own experiences as a student, knowing how complicated and overwhelming it can be when you are first exposed to topics like cellular and molecular biology, it all makes me think about how we can lay a good foundation for young students regarding these increasingly relevant yet complex topics. To me, it feels like part of the answer could be engaging content creation, as well as leveraging new frontiers such as the metaverse. Sort of like, gamifying learning biology - what if it was like a video game or a puzzle game? And there are parallels between that and scientific research. Biology is a complex puzzle that scientists are still trying to unravel and solve, and probably will be forever or for at least the foreseeable future. And that brings me to my last point about the potential of using the metaverse as a teaching tool - what if it could also be a tool for connection between eager, curious students and scientists who can visit virtual spaces to present their work. What if connection and learning in a virtual space - interaction between students and academics anywhere in the world - could result in real-life, real-world mentorship? There will be a lot of work to be done, such as optimizing metaverse spaces for lower-resource environments where computer hardware and internet speeds could be significant barriers - this includes many schools, which may have outdated computers, without powerful graphics cards. However, I think there is a lot of potential here, and there are already some browser-based metaverse platforms that have made significant leaps in that area - and that is why this is something I have chosen to dedicate more time and energy and thought to.
