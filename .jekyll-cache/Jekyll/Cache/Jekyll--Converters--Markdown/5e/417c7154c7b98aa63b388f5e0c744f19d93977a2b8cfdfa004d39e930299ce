<i>The original cell town video assignment - created in 2015.</i>
</center>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Cell Town started as a biology assignment in high school - I built it from scratch in Google Sketchup when I was 14 years old. I am revisiting it now as an adult studying biomedical engineering, with the question of how digital tools and analogies can be used to help teach complicated topics such as biology.</p>

<p>I wonder, how can we envision, simulate, approximate, and animate the inner workings and complexities of very complicated things such as cells? Could we take things such as vesicle transport and enzymatic reactions and DNA replication - and make these concepts come alive? Can we create virtual worlds that allow students to literally explore a cell or a cell analogy?</p>

<p>I know that biomedical engineering - and particularly synthetic biology, cell-based biosensors, and cell-component based bio-computers - are all going to play a major role in the future of humanity. And from my own experiences as a student, knowing how complicated and overwhelming it can be when you are first exposed to topics like cellular and molecular biology, it all makes me think about how we can lay a good foundation for young students regarding these increasingly relevant yet complex topics.</p>

<p>To me, it feels like part of the answer could be engaging content creation, as well as leveraging new frontiers such as the metaverse. Sort of like, gamifying learning biology - what if it was like a video game or a puzzle game? And there are parallels between that and scientific research. Biology is a complex puzzle that scientists are still trying to unravel and solve, and probably will be forever or for at least the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>That brings me to my last point about the potential of using the metaverse as a teaching tool - what if it could also be a tool for connection between eager, curious students and scientists who can visit virtual spaces to present their work. What if connection and learning in a virtual space - interaction between students and academics anywhere in the world - could result in real-life, real-world mentorship?</p>

<p>There will be a lot of work to be done, such as optimizing metaverse spaces for lower-resource environments where computer hardware and internet speeds could be significant barriers - this includes many schools, which may have outdated computers, without powerful graphics cards. However, I think there is a lot of potential here, and there are already some browser-based metaverse platforms that have made significant leaps in that area - and that is why this is something I have chosen to dedicate more time and energy and thought to.</p>

<p>I have been working on creating new Cell Town renderings and animations in Blender, a powerful 3D animation software, to help make the original model come even more alive. I have been looking into how I could make an improved version of the original model and video that includes more complex topics and elaboration into the functions of the various organelles. Finally, I have created a metaverse space based on the original model using the Mona metaverse platform, and am hoping to create an even more interactive metaverse space for the new cell model as well when it is completed - with this space, I aim to incorporate some of the elements I touched on before about creating a metaverse space optimized for interactive, engaging learning, collaboration, and mentorship.</p>

<p>The Cell Town V1.0 metaverse space is still in the process of finalization and quality assurance, however, the link will be available on this page once it is approved and live online. If you would like to walk explore the Cell Town Space right now, you can do so by uploading the Playground Files to the Monaverse Playground Space (see guide here). Finally, as part of the Monaverse workflow, all of the live iterations of the Cell Town Spaces will be minted as NFTs.</p>

<h2 id="design-process-of-original-cell-town-video">Design Process of Original Cell Town Video</h2>
<p>The process of designing the original cell town began with a lot of research. There were several things to look into, right off the bat. Firstly, I needed to do independent research on the functions of the various organelles of the cell, to ensure that the analogy made sense and that the content was factual. Secondly, because I had decided early on that my theme would not just be comparing cells to a regular town, but to a town of the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù, I researched a lot of news articles of promising inventions and ideas that could change urban landscapes.</p>

<p><em>Some personal context here is that, when I was a young teenager, I was very passionate and excited about what the future could look like, I was excited about the idea of ‚Äúfuturism‚Äù and how current scientific research will shape the landscape of the future. I liked to think about what the world would look like in the year 2100, and spent a lot of my time visiting a website called Futurism that focused on emerging technology (in fact, I created a raspberry pi wall projector alarm clock for my bedroom that had an embedded Futurism feed).</em></p>

<p>After the research phase, I began the sketching phase, where I individually sketched out the building/urban feature analogy for each organelle. Unfortunately, I do not have any high quality photos or scans of the sketches, but luckily, I have this video that I captured for the end credits of my original cell town video:</p>

<p>After sketching phase, I started to individually model each organelle analogy, in separate Sketchup files. I used google images to source textures to bring each model to life, and I created the base file that would eventually encompass the entire cell town with all of its organelles. During the modelling process, I also started considering how I wanted the overall information flow of the video to behave. I added three dimensional text descriptions to some of the models, as an extension of the subtitles that I knew I would include in the final product.</p>

<p>Once all of the organelles were modeled and imported into the main Cell Town file in Sketchup, I started Animating. In Sketchup, you can create ‚Äúanimations‚Äù that allow you to wander around and explore the model. I orbited and panned around the model and used the animation tab to save each position and transition. I recorded and exported some rough clips of the general flow of the video that I would like to achieve, and iterated until I found a flow that worked well. I was especially trying to be mindful of preventing the experience from being dizzying for the user.</p>

<p>The final step was editing the video in Windows Movie Maker, adding the subtitles, credits, and royalty-free music. As part of preventing the video from being dizzying, I chose to have the clips of the model be nested within a thick black border, with the subtitle text in a large font on the bottom edge. I wanted the viewer to be able to focus on the subtitle text, since the subtitle text provides a lot of the context for the video, which is why I chose not to overlay the text directly on top of the model and opted for the thick border instead. I chose the song ‚ÄúAdventures‚Äù by A Himitsu because I wanted a calm but dreamy and adventurous feel to the video - I wanted the viewer to feel like they are exploring a dreamy town of the future while learning about organelles in the process. At the end of the video, I made sure to include some of the news links that inspired some of my models, as well as image credits for the various textures I used.</p>

<h2 id="impacts-of-the-original-design">Impacts of the Original Design</h2>
<p>Years after I created it, this cell analogy video has been used by teachers at my high school as a resource for introducing the cell and organelles.</p>

<p>My high school biology teacher, Ms. Wilson, was especially very supportive of my work: After telling me how much she loved the video, she really encouraged me to continue to follow my curiosity and see where it leads me, and to see what I learn along the way. She would often send me links to interesting opportunities in science education, from summer schools to research vessels, and although my life circumstances at the time prevented me from pursuing those opportunities, I really credit her with inspiring me to dream big.</p>
