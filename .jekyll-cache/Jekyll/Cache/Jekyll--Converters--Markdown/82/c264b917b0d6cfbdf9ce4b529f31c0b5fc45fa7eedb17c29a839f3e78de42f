I"’<p>This is my first blog post. I am writing it from my phone, while on the DC metro.</p>

<p>It will probably be integrated into the website later, and probably edited.</p>

<p>However, I am trying to explore the possibilities for using github/markdown to write down my thoughts while out and about.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve heard it said that Github could be a good resource to not just programmers, but also writers, because it could be a pretty seamless platform for hosting, updating, and managing multiple versions and iterations of their work. Markdown as well is a great tool for writing down your thoughts, with no need for a rich text editor, and all formatting done through characters/symbols. I am interested in exploring this further - I am currently composing this on the github website, after pressing ‚Äúadd a file‚Äù, however, maybe I can look into options for mobile text editors and mobile git clients.</p>

<p>I am almost at my stop, but may add to these ideas later.</p>
