Aloha, I am Sophia! :hibiscus:</p>

<p>I am a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. I am originally from Maui, an island in the Hawaiian Islands (USA). :palm_tree:</p>

<p>I am an alumna of <a href="http://www.kiheicharter.org/">Kihei Charter School</a>, where I graduated in 2018. I am also proud to be an alumna of the Maui Economic Development Board Women in Technologyâ€™s <a href="https://www.stemworkshawaii.org/">STEMworksâ„¢ program</a> and the Nalukai Foundationâ€™s <a href="https://nalukai.org/">Nalukai Academy Startup Camp</a> (2016 cohort). If you have been looking through my work, especially my projects from high school, and if you like what you see, please consider supporting these organizations that make a such a major difference in the education and future of Maui youth. You can donate to <a href="http://www.kiheicharter.org/support-kihei-charter-school">Kihei Charter School here</a>, to <a href="https://www.stemworkshawaii.org/donate">STEMworksâ„¢ Hawaii here</a>, and to the <a href="https://nalukai.org/donate">Nalukai Foundation here</a>. The Nalukai Foundation and STEMworksâ„¢ program also support youth across the entire state of Hawaiâ€™i, not just Maui County.</p>

<p>As you can see from my projects, I really enjoy making things, learning new things, picking up new hobbies, and combining various interests. In my project work, I am particularly interested in the intersection of art, outreach, and STEM education. For my future career, I am very interested in the intersection of biology and computing. :herb::mag:</p>

<h2 id="about-this-website">About This Website</h2>
<p>I designed and built this website using mainly Jekyll, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The project gallery was made using jQuery and Masonry. The emojis are displayed thanks to the Jemoji plugin. :thumbsup: The website is deployed via Github Pages.</p>

<p>This website was designed with intention to be partly a portfolio website that describes my current and past projects, as well as various skills and hobbies Iâ€™ve worked on throughout the years. It is also a personal website, aiming to have space for writing and reflection on various interests, goal-setting and growth, and - in the future - hopefully some interactive storytelling elements. Overall, a place to put all of the things that interest me, and lots of projects that Iâ€™m proud of. <strong>Mahalo nui loa for visiting!</strong> :sparkling_heart:</p>
