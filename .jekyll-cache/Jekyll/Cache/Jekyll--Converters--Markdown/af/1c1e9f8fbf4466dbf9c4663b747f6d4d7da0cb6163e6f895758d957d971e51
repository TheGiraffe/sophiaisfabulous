<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I taught coding classes at my high school as part of my Senior Project, and then continued to design coding curriculum afterward. This project involved teaching four weeks of coding classes (six classes total) to the Sophomore engineering class. Outside of the class, I tried to increase code literacy at my school by creating a KCS Code Club, as well as designing and distributing a ‚ÄúKCS Code Zine‚Äù publication that focused on Creative Programming. I designed and printed lots of qr code stickers linking to the CodeKCS website and put them in the front office for people to take and scan. I also designed fliers to advertise the Code Club, and built and designed the CodeKCS website from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS to showcase learning resources.</p>

<h4 id="binary-abacus">Binary Abacus</h4>
<p>The original plan was to give away an 8-bit ‚Äúbinary abacus‚Äù as a freebie within the KCS Code Zine - it would have been in a separate envelope attached to the back of the zine, as a 3D-printed kit, with its own separate instruction sheet and a binary code alphabet table. The idea was that the abacus doubled as both a fidget toy and a way of better understanding how binary works - the students could use the abacus to code for single letters of the alphabet by setting each column to 0 or 1 (down or up, off or on).</p>

</p>

<p>Although I managed to 3D print enough kits and cut enough wires for the beads, I never ended up including the binary abacus in the final Code Zines. This is partly because I spent too much time trying to iterate on and refine the model (such as trying to include 3D-printed poles for the beads instead), and I ended up deciding that, time-wise, it would be better just to print and publish the zines as-is. I didn‚Äôt want to include the kit without well-written instructions, explanations, and learning objectives - so I just decided to omit it from the publication.</p>
