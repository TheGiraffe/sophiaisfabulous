<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I taught coding classes at my high school as part of my Senior Project, and then
continued to design coding curriculum afterward. This project involved teaching four
weeks of coding classes (six classes total) to the Sophomore engineering class. Outside
of the class, I tried to increase code literacy at my school by creating a KCS Code Club,
as well as designing and distributing a “KCS Code Zine” publication that focused on
Creative Programming. I designed and printed lots of qr code stickers linking to the
CodeKCS website and put them in the front office for people to take and scan. I also
designed fliers to advertise the Code Club, and built and designed the CodeKCS website
from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS to showcase learning resources.</p>
