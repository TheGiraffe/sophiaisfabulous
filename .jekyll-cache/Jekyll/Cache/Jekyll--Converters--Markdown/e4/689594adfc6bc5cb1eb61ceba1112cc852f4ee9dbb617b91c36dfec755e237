<h5 id="ideas">Ideas</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Put together a team to organize and run a Maui Hackathon, maybe with the support of county council, and local economic development, education, and STEM organizations. Have there be workshops hosted by local tech businesses, STEM groups, and professionals. Have challenges and prizes sponsored + awarded by local businesses, nonprofits, and Hawai’i state agencies. Particularly focus on the skill-sharing aspect, make it part Skillshare part Hackathon I guess? Most importantly, make it open to everyone - young people, adults, keiki, students, professionals, people who are employed or unemployed, people in every field, people who work for the government, etc. Have it hosted somewhere in Kahului that is accessible to a lot of people.</li>
  <li>Write an article about how amazing public libraries are, highlighting all of the awesome resources that are available, that people may not know about. Talk about why, as a society, we should pour more money into our local public libraries - it is a rewarding investment into our communities and our future!</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="learning">Learning</h5>
<ul>
  <li>See if there’s some sort of online course I can take about DaVinci Resolve / video production and editing techniques, so that I can improve my skills in that area (and have some formal instruction on it!)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="books">Books</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The Code Breaker by Walter Isaacson was an amazing, inspiring book that made me think a lot about Biomedical Engineering, gene editing, synthetic biology, education, access, and inclusion, and many ethical concerns. It gave me a mild existential crisis, but in a good way - it really made me think about and question the “why” behind a lot of innovation in my chosen field. I would (and probably will!) absolutely read it again.</li>
