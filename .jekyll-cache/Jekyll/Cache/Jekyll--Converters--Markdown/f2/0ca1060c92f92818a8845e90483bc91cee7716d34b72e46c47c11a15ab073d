<p>So if I remember correctly, after all these years, the story goes like this. One night when I was a Junior in high school, I had a lot on my mind and I couldnâ€™t sleep, so I pulled an all-nighter and made myself a pair of light-up cat ears.</p>

<i>I did put the parts list on my Instagram, but never got around to making the Instructable.</i>
</p>

<p>Cat Ear V1.0 was my absolute favorite accessory as a teenager! I would wear the headband everywhere - to school, to the supermarket, on the bus, on dates, literally everywhere. Especially on days when I needed extra confidence (such as for a Calculus quiz), or for parties/holidays like Mardi Gras. I even wore them some days when I was up at the front of the room teaching the CodeKCS class in Senior Year.</p>

<i>I was sixteen years old at the time. I was - and still am - absolutely obsessed with cats. The cat shown in the video was our beloved cat Rumba.</i>
<br />
<i>Rumba, you are so very loved and so very missed :heart:</i>
