## Personal Mission Statement *(work in progress)*

*It is my mission to live a life of sincerity and integrity, by treating others with kindness, respect, and compassion, and by setting healthy boundaries regarding my time and energy in order to have healthy, uplifting relationships. I strive to make a difference in my communities through my art, inventions, and role as a maker and a designer. I hope to help alleviate suffering, uplift people, share my knowledge, and make others and myself feel a little more hope and joy. I aim to always be curious, and open to new experiences and ideas.*
