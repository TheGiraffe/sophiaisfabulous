projectdescription: <p>Designing medical devices that are friendlier, less threatening, and overall provide a better user experience - particularly for children, who may feel quite scared after being diagnosed with asthma. Friendlier, more eye-catching designs for medical products may also help reduce medical non-adherence, particularly for daily preventative treatments.</p>

## Overview

This was a group project for university, the Biomedical Engineering Skills 2 (ENG 2012) asthma inhaler project. My group designed Asthimo, a customizable and kid-friendly, robot-shaped inhaler for children aged 6-12.
