So if I remember correctly, after all these years, the story goes like this. One night when I was a Junior in high school, I had a lot on my mind and I couldn't sleep, so I pulled an all-nighter and made myself a pair of light-up cat ears. Then I posted about it to Instagram.

<i>I did put the parts list on my Instagram, but never got around to making the Instructable.</i>

Cat Ears V1.0 was my absolute favorite accessory as a teenager! I would wear the headband everywhere - to school, to the supermarket, on the bus, on dates, literally everywhere. Especially on days when I needed extra confidence (such as for a Calculus quiz), or for parties/holidays like Mardi Gras. I even wore them some days when I was up at the front of the room teaching the CodeKCS class in Senior Year.

<i>I was sixteen years old when I made these ears. I was - and still am - absolutely obsessed with cats.</i>
<br>
<i>The cat shown in the video was our beloved cat Rumba.</i>
<br>
<i>Rumba, you are so very loved and so very missed.</i> :heartpulse:
<br>
<i>You were the light in my life amid so much darkness, and the reason why I am still here today.</i>
