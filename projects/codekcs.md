projectdescription: <p>Designing medical devices that are friendlier, less threatening, and overall provide a better user experience - particularly for children, who may feel quite scared after being diagnosed with asthma. Friendlier, more eye-catching designs for medical products may also help reduce medical non-adherence, particularly for daily preventative treatments.</p>
